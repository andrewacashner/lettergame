How to Install
--------------

There is a prepackage application bundle for Mac OSX.
Soon we hope to have prepackaged application bundles for Linux and Windows.

 - On a Unix-like system
    + Install Ruby if not already provided
    + Install Gosu
        - Follow Gosu's own installation instructions
	- You have to install several package dependencies first, then install the Gosu gem
    + Download letter.tar.gz from the releases/v0.1/linux/ directory; 
      then unpack it: `gunzip letters.tar.gz`; `tar -xf letters.tar`
    + OR Clone this repository 
    + Inside the game's directory, run `ruby letters.rb`
    + Alternately, make it executable, `chmod +x letters.rb` and then `./letters.rb` (or put it in the system path)

 - On Mac OSX
    + Download Letters.app.zip from the releases/v0.1/OSX/ directory
    + Unzip the archive and copy Letters.app into your Applications directory
 
 - On Windows (not yet available)
    + If you have a Ruby setup, you should be able to install Gosu and clone this repository, like in the instructions for Linux.
    + Soon we hope to have a Windows application bundle.
